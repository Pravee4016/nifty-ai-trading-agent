## Key Risk Management Rules

1. **Stop Loss**: Exit if loss reaches 50% of max profit potential
2. **Time Decay**: Best to enter on Monday/Tuesday for weekly expiry
3. **IV Check**: Avoid selling when VIX is very low (buy opportunities instead)
4. **Position Sizing**: Never allocate more than 40% to a single strategy
5. **Rolling**: If tested, roll strikes to next week instead of taking loss

## Today's Specific Trade Recommendations

### If entered at 10:00 AM (after opening range):
**Iron Condor**: 26,200/26,400 Call Spread + 25,600/25,400 Put Spread
- Premium collected: ~₹80-100 per lot

---

## Hindsight Analysis: What Actually Worked

Given today's market behavior:
- ✅ **Iron Condor**: Would have given full premium
- ✅ **Bull Put Spread**: Safe profit
- ✅ **Calendar Spread**: Time decay favored short leg
- ⚠️ **Short Straddle**: Profitable but nerve-wracking (needed 26,000 call protection)
- ❌ **Directional Bets**: Only -0.55% move, long options would have lost to theta

---

## Tomorrow's Setup

If similar low-volatility conditions continue:
1. **Repeat Iron Condor** with wider wings (±300-400 points)
2. **Consider Iron Butterfly** for higher premium (riskier)
3. **Avoid directional trades** unless VIX spikes or clear trend emerges

---

## Final Recommendation for Your Profile

**BEST STRATEGY**: **Iron Condor (2 lots) + Bull Put Spread (2 lots)**

**Total Capital**: ₹1,60,000  
**Expected Weekly Return**: ₹14,000 - ₹18,000  
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Win Rate**: ~70%  
**Buffer**: ₹40,000 for adjustments  

This combination:
- ✅ Fits your risk appetite (minimum risk)
- ✅ Provides moderate returns (8-11% weekly)
- ✅ Works well in low-volatility, range-bound markets
- ✅ Allows for position adjustments
- ✅ Diversifies risk across multiple strikes
